Thank you for your interest in Sciency. 


## Vision

Our vision is to make science accessible and relatable.



## Plan

We hope to radically increase the current scientific understanding of people with a special emphasis on non-English speaking communities. The first step in this direction is the creation of a journal that will contain articles published in at least two languages.

| Phase | Description | Article Types | Submission Procedure |
|:---|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Pilot | Create a website for hosting the journal. Define the acceptance criterion for short articles. Promote the idea and publish accepted peer-reviewed articles. | Letter | email |
| α1 | Formalise the organisation. Find volunteers for copy-editing and promotion. Add usage statics.  Initiate meeting of requirements for promotion to a recognised journal status. | Letter | email |
| α2 | Design a user-feedback system. Create an automated authors' log-in and submission area. | Letter+  | web submission |
